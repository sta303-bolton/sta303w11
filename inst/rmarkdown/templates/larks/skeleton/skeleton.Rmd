This example based on a talk by [Gavin Simpson](https://github.com/gavinsimpson).

## Get the data

The `gamair` package is the package for the GAM book by Wood (2016), see the syllabus for full reference.

```{r birds-1, message = FALSE}
library(gamair) # you may need to install this
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggthemes)
library(mgcv)
data(bird)
glimpse(bird)
```

We're going to transform things a little to make them easier to use. You can find the description of each variable by running `?bird` in your console. It will open the help file. We want to scale the location to be in 1000s of kilimeters.

```{r}
bird <- transform(bird,
            crestlark = factor(crestlark),
            linnet = factor(linnet),
            e = x / 1000,
            n = y / 1000)
head(bird)
```

### Plot it!
```{r birds-2}
ggplot(bird, aes(x = e, y = n, colour = crestlark)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.5) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  scale_colour_discrete(na.value = '#bbbbbb33') + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


## Binomial GAM


```{r birds-gam-1}
crest <- gam(crestlark ~ s(e, n, k = 100),
             data = bird,
             family = binomial,
             method = 'REML')
```

$s(e, n)$ indicated by `s(e, n)` in the formula. Our default is thin plate splines, which is a pretty good default.

Recall that `k` sets size of basis dimension; upper limit on EDF.

Smoothness parameters estimated via REML.

```{r birds-gam-2}
summary(crest)
```


Model checking with binary data is a pain with binomial models because our residuals look weird!

Alternatively we can aggregate data at the `QUADRICULA` level & fit a binomial _count_ model.

```{r convert-larks, echo = TRUE}
## convert back to numeric
bird <- transform(bird,
                  crestlark = as.numeric(as.character(crestlark)),
                  linnet = as.numeric(as.character(linnet)))
## some variables to help aggregation
bird <- transform(bird, tet.n = rep(1, nrow(bird)),
                  N = rep(1, nrow(bird)), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
## set to NA if not surveyed
bird$N[is.na(as.vector(bird$crestlark))] <- NA
## aggregate
bird2 <- aggregate(data.matrix(bird), by = list(bird$QUADRICULA),
                   FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
## scale by Quads aggregated
bird2 <- transform(bird2, e = e / tet.n, n = n / tet.n)
## fit binomial GAM
crest2 <- gam(cbind(crestlark, N - crestlark) ~ s(e, n, k = 100),
              data = bird2, family = binomial, method = 'REML')
```


## Model checking

```{r crest-3, echo = TRUE}
crest3 <- gam(cbind(crestlark, N - crestlark) ~
                  s(e, n, k = 100),
              data = bird2, family = quasibinomial,
              method = 'REML')
```


Model residuals don't look too bad. The bands of points we see are due to wroking with integers. Some overdispersion, $\phi$ = `r round(crest3$scale,2)`$


```{r gam-check-aggregated-lark}
ggplot(data.frame(Fitted = fitted(crest2),
                  Resid = resid(crest2)),
       aes(Fitted, Resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r}
library(gratia)
appraise(crest3)
gam.check(crest3)
```
